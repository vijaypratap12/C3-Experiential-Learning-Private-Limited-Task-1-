            <p>Water is the most plentiful compound on Earth and is essential to life. A vital nutrient to the life of every cell, acts first as a building material.
It regulates our internal body temperature by sweating and respiration.
The carbohydrates and proteins that our bodies use as food are metabolized and transported by water in the bloodstream.
It assists in flushing waste mainly through urination. It
acts as a shock absorber for brain, spinal cord, and fetus. It forms saliva in our body.

            Each day humans must consume a certain amount of water to survive. Of course, this varies according to age and gender, and also by where someone lives. Generally, an adult male needs about 3 liters (3.2 quarts) per day while an adult female needs about 2.2 liters (2.3 quarts) per day. All of the water a person needs does not have to come from drinking liquids, as some of this water is contained in the food we eat.</p></div></div>
